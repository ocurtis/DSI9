One reason we want to grab content from this site, is that the site has a well formatted archive of older albums that we are unlikely to pick up from other data sources (NeedleDrop is newer, Pitchfork doesn't cover oolder material as much. They unfortunately do not have an API. With that said, the workflow in this notebook is as follows:\n",
