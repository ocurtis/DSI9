"The Chicken and the Horse (Dirty, Long)","On a farm lived a chicken and a horse, good friends who enjoyed long leisurely walks together. 

One day, their walk brought them to a swamp, in which the horse started to sink. ""Quickly!"" he cried, ""run to the farmer's garage, throw a rope into his BMW, drive it over here, tie me to it, and pull me out!"" The chicken, following the horse's directions, successfully saves the horse from drowning in the swamp. 

Days later, on another walk, they once again happen upon the swamp, and this time, the chicken gets stuck. ""Quick!"" she cries, ""get me out, same as I did you!""

""Fortunately,"" the horse answered, ""I don't need the rope, or the car."" He then proceeded to pull the chicken out by extending his penis out for her to grab onto, thus saving her from sinking in the swamp.

Genie in a bottle...,"A young man was walking along one of Southern California's sandy beaches with his surf board. He suddenly spots this bottle which has recently washed up on the beach. It's obvious it's been tossed around for a long time. He picks up the bottle and notices that it still has the cork intact. So, being curious as to what may be inside, he manages to get the cork out and out pops a Genie.

After expressing profound appreciation for having been let out of the bottle, the Genie grants his benefactor the classic, ""one wish"" and it will be yours. Being an avid surfer, it doesn't take him long to say,
""I've always wanted to surf Hawaii, but I get seasick on ships and I'm afraid to fly. Would you build me a bridge to Hawaii?""

The Genie replies: 
""Do you know what you are asking for? Do you know how long the bridge would have to be? Think of the enormous challenges for that kind of undertaking. The supports required to reach the bottom of the Pacific! The concrete and steel it would take! It will nearly exhaust several natural resources. And the maintenance of that bridge! No, think of another wish.""

The man said OK and tried to think of a really good wish. Finally, he said, 

""I've been on reddit for years now, and love it very much. I Especially love r/jokes, they make me laugh every day, or they use too. The problem is that people keep reposting jokes trying to earn upvotes. And it gets to the point where I have to read the same joke over and over. And it kills me!!! So I wish that there was never a repost joke on r/jokes. That is my wish “

After a long sigh, the Genie responds:

John was starting to worry about his 12 year old son Jack.,"Jack was a D student, and only because John helped complete all of Jack's homework. Jack wasn't good at sports. He didn't have many friends. And it seemed like once a week he was getting called into the principal's office for some sort of misbehavior. So John told Jack, in a last ditch effort to get his son to commit to something, that Jack was going to join the school band. Jack protested, but John put his foot down.

Then the next day, John got a call at the office. He answered, ""Hello?"" A voice asked, ""Is this John Robertson?"" ""Yes,"" John said. ""Jack Robertson's father?"" ""...Yes,"" John said, a little worried. ""This is Sam Thompson, I'm the music teacher at Jack's school."" John sighed. ""What has he done now?"" 

""Well,"" Sam said, ""It turns out we have a real Elvis Presley on our hands."" 

It took John a second to register, because it caught him by such surprise. That was maybe the kindest thing anyone had ever said about his son. Despite himself, John felt tears burn behind his eyes, a feeling of fatherly pride bubbling up, possibly for the first time ever. His breath caught for a moment before he asked, ""Really? Jack is--Jack's good at music?"" 

""Oh no no no,"" Sam said, ""He's dead on the toilet.""

A gamer and a musician share a car,"Edward and Anthony are roommates. They met in college and have been best friends ever since. They both loved music and video games. Anthony has been making money by buying old instruments at pawn shops, fixing them up, and then selling them for a profit. Edward was still looking for work and spent his days submitting resumes and catching up on his Steam backlog.

They shared an apartment, and shared ownership of a red 2001 Oldsmobile Alero that Edward was given as a graduation present in high school that was already ancient when he got it but it stayed in surprisingly good condition. Anthony hated the car. It smelled like stale Doritos and spilled Mt. Dew but he couldn't complain too much because it was completely free and miraculously only had 100k miles on it, despite being so old.

One day Anthony decided to go to an old pawn shop in one of the original parts of town. To his surprise, he saw a lute. An actual lute. He had been mostly fixing guitars and instruments that belonged in the brass section of a high school marching bands at this point so the idea of taking home and fixing this instrument brought a sense of pride and accomplishment that he felt like he really needed. He purchased the item for a mere $50. It was pretty big and had a wonky shape. He put it in the backseat of the Alero but was worried about snapping the neck or damaging the body of it.  His worries were amplified when the lute began rocking when he would accelerate or stop.

In a panic, he started searching the internet with his phone, looking for a place nearby that could sell him a case (the pawn shop didn't have one.) He glanced up to his phone just in time to see the stopped car in front of him and he swerved to narrowly miss the vehicle and go off the road. There was a pretty big banging sound as his car jumped the curb and a sickening crunch that followed. Anthony's heart sank. The lute had shot into the air and landed poorly, snapping a part of the neck on the floorboard. Of course it did. 

Thankfully, nobody was hurt and that's the important part, right? He was out $50 but he and the car were both OK.  He started driving again and... the car was pulling to the right. This day couldn't get any worse. Not knowing what to do, he debated on calling Edward to see if he had a specific place he wanted to take it to where seemingly out of nowhere a truck pulled up. 

The driver rolled down the window and asked in a slow drawl if Anthony needed any help. Anthony sheepishly nodded, told him what had happened, and started to ask if the man knew of an auto repair shop nearby when three men he hadn't noticed before jumped out of the bed of the truck. One carried a jack, two more carried tools he didn't quite recognize and before he knew it they were working on the old Alero. He heard hammering and clanking. The driver explained that the car was so old it wasn't worth putting in new parts, but they'd figure out a way to hammer everything back into place. About ten minutes later the car was being lowered back to the ground and they got back into the truck. Sure enough, the car seemed to drive pretty straight. It'd still need an alignment or some work later on but it would work for now.

He drove home, cleaned out the back seat, came inside and admitted to Edward that he had a small accident when he was driving while distracted, but fortunately a nice group of strangers came out of nowhere and fixed the car. Edward was angry at first, maybe just because he was disappointed but Anthony had never seen him like this. Edward seethed ""What was so important that you were driving MY CAR while on the phone?"" Hurriedly and apologetically, Anthony told him about the bargain that he had found at the pawn shop, the problems he was having driving, and the case he was searching for. Then, out of nowhere Edward just started laughing. Shocked, Anthony asked if everything was OK. He was afraid his long-time friend had completely snapped.

Shaking his head, Edward said ""Of course this would happen! You tried to buy a lute box and ended up with surprise mechanics.""",1,False,1569529482,Jokes,0,/r/Jokes/comments/d9pco1/a_gamer_and_a_musician_share_a_car/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d9pco1/a_gamer_and_a_musician_share_a_car/,d9pco1,UsuallyNever,

A man with two buckets of fish,"was leaving a lake well known for its fishing and was stopped by a game warden. The warden asked the man, ""Do you have a license to catch those fish?"" 

The man replied to the game warden, ""No, sir. These are my pet fish.""

""Yes, sir. Every night I take these fish down to this lake and let them swim around for about a half-hour, When I whistle, they all come back, jump back into my buckets, and I take 'em home. We do this every night."" 

""That's a bunch of hooey,"" said the warden. ""Fish can't do that!""

""No, really! says the man. ""Here, I'll show you."" And he releases the fish in the lake.

""Well, I've GOT to see this!"" the game warden replied.

Toilet humor. (Long),"No Sicilians were harms in the making of this post (said with wiseguy accent)...

Just woke up with this stuck in my head, complete BS, anyway -

So I go to a wedding in an undisclosed location in New York City.  
The happy couple just got married, but haven't left the building yet, I along with a ton of my friends and a few made guys are drinking having a great time - this was a ""non family"" function so everyone was enjoying themselves, but an anomaly was happening in the men's room... 

There was individually wrapped slices of cheese stacking up on the stalls, around the sink, and on top of trash can near the door - and it was driving everyone nuts, because no cheese was being served at the wedding or the reception - it was just so fucking weird.

Now there's two kinds of guys that kinda look alike. Made guys - and the ones that act\* like they are made guys, you know the type - Wanna be made but too trash to qualify, because they're just a piece of shit in an expensive suit.

Course it was a wedding, and everyone is trying to get some bridesmaid twat, so even those wanna be worthless idiots that can't afford lunch were looking as sharp as possible hoping for get laid with one of the chicks that were either too dumb or too drunk to tell the difference. Good times... but seriously - the cheese was fucking everywhere - but just\* in the mens' room.

Everyone's toasting and drinking and I gather up like a solid 24 pack of the fucking cheese and put it in front  of the father of the bride as a joke saying it's a wedding gift. The father of the bride was not amused, and he only knew about the cheese earlier in the day when there was like 3-4 slices, and now he has a 48 pack of fucking bathroom cheese in front of him... he goes to the band, stops the music and takes the microphone.

""Who's bringing in this damned cheese into my daughter's wedding?"" he boomed.  
We all knew and liked the old man - but he was not all there - but when he brought this up , he kinda had a point.  
I mean who the fuck sneaks in cheese to a bathroom anyway, and then just leaves it there?  
It's not even the good kind - it's Velveeta cheese or some knockoff brand version.

Dead silence - for an entire minute.

Everyone laughs it off because the women have no idea how the cheese just appeared at random, and the guys don't really want to tell anyone that the men's room is full of fucking individually wrapped slices of cheese.

Being the kinda guy I am about a block away I know there's a bar where I can get some hard liquor, instead of wine or champagne - because those are girly drinks - and getting hammered is easier with a few shots - and on the way to the bar there's a deli with a mostly empty free sample tray - ok so found the place where the cheese was picked up, but not how it got into the bathroom.

I have my few shots and check out the men's room at the bar Zero fucking cheese... I'm baffled, then i take a look around the bar and see that it's full of poser, wanna be, dirt poor, a-holes drinking liquid courage until they have the never to talk to a girl.

And then it clicked. All these poor horny, cowardly, insecure, useless drags on society that couldn't get laid with a wad of hundreds in one hand and incapable of managing their way out of an open ended paper bag are taking all the cheddar from the community - putting it in their pocket - but don't want any chick to find out about it, so they leave it in the men's room knowing full well if a chick finds out they're keeping cheese in their pockets, they won't get laid - but are too cheapskate to get rid of it, because they need it to live off of, if they don't get lucky. 

No one want's to be the guy hoarding processed cheese in their socks.

Three horses are arguing in a stable,"Each one is convinced they are a better racer than the other two. Thus, the three bicker and brag and talk over one another.

""Now see here, see here!"" Says the first horse. ""I have been racing for four years, and every summer of those ten years I have come in first every race I ran!""

""That's pathetic you old has-been,"" says the second horse. ""I once went an entire year getting first place in all my races!""

""You think that's impressive?"" says the first horse. ""Why I've gotten first place so many times I have lost track!""

The three horses continue to argue, loudly at that. Nearby is an old greyhound trying to take a nap. Fed up with all the senseless bickering, he jumps up and yells at the horses.

""Hey!"" the old dog yells. ""I'll have you know that I raced for a very, very long time and I didn't once lose a single race! I ran and I sweat and bled until I couldn't anymore. I went out on top, so do you think maybe I deserve half an hour of shut-eye?""

A blonde wants to travel abroad.,"She parks her car in front of a bank near the airport and gets out with her trolleys. She then enters the bank and walks to the next teller.

Blonde: Hello, I want to get a loan for $1000,-

Teller: Very well. But I need a credit security in order to grant you that loan. 

Blonde: How about my car? It is right in front of the bank entrance. 

The teller takes a look through the glass door: Very well, this car is valuable enough. 

The blonde and the teller exchange keys and loan. After that, the blonde walks off with her trolleys and gets to her airplane.

Two weeks later she returns to the bank with her trolleys and sees the teller she had received her loan from 2 weeks ago. 

The blonde approaches the teller: Hello mister. I have taken a loan of $1000,- from you and I wish to return it today and get my car back.

Teller: Very well, I accept your payment of $1000,- with an additional $5,- as interest. If you pay off the total of $1005,- , then you will get your car keys back. 

The blonde and the teller exchange the money for the car keys. Before the blonde walks off, the teller asks her one last question. 

Teller: Excuse my curiosity, but why did you leave your car for security in exchange of that small amount of money?

"In the great desert lived a bunch of nomads. Their leader, Benny, had risen to his rank due to his magnificent beard. His people believed a man's strength and courage came from his beard, and thus the man with the biggest beard was their chief.","After leading the band for many years, Benny began to feel uncomfortable wearing the beard, in this hot and dusty land. He wanted to shave it off, so he called his council together to get their advice. When he said he wanted to shave, the council-men were shocked. One said, ""Do you not remember the ancient legend, dire? The leader who removes his beard is cursed and made into a piece of earthenware."" Benny had heard this legend, but being a modern man, he scoffed at the tale.

He was headstrong, so went ahead and cut and scraped away his magnificent beard. As the final whisker was cut off, a huge dust storm came up. It lasted only a few seconds, and when it cleared there was a man-sized clay vessel where only moments before had stood their leader.

The council then knew the legend must be true. Their conclusion?

The genie of the lamp,"A hipster goes to an antique market where he spots a cool looking brass lamp. It's only $20, so he buys and takes it home.
He spots a black mark on the side so he gets out the brass polish and rubs it to remove the mark. There's a flash and this giant Middle Eastern dude appeares in his lounge. ""I am the genie of the lamp, I shall grant you 3 wishes."" The hero of our story is quite surprised and can't think of a good wish on the spot. Then suddenly he has it. ""I hate flying and planes are destroying the environment, but my grandma lives in London. I wish for you to build me a road across the Atlantic, so I can drive my electric car, and visit her whenever I like."" The genie is visibly not happy ""Have you any idea of the size of undertaking you are asking for? I'll have to lay concrete piles and massive columns all along the route it will have to be taller than the largest wave.

A joke I got from an old 1860s newspaper,"There was a petty robbery case being tried in a local court. The defendant was accused of stealing from a local shoemaker, who was there to testify. Thankfully, the defendant had a very well-know local lawyer who was famous for his ability to cross-reference witnesses.

He prompts the shoemaker: ""You say sir, that the defendant is a thief?""

""Yes sir, and I'll tell you why. She confessed it!""

The lawyer grinned and continued, ""You also say that after she confessed, you had her assist you in making shoes?""

""Yes sir.""

The lawyer breaks out into a big smile and turns theatrically to the court, ""If this is true, why would you continue to employ the defendant? Unless we now understand you employ dishonest people, even after their rascalities are known?""

The caretaker of a generation ship was on his death bed,"Many years before, Antoine had helped place all his friends and family into cryogenic sleep. He was a young man then and they all knew that he would likely be long dead by the time they reached their destination. They said their tearful goodbyes and drifted off to sleep.

In the years he spent alone on the ship, he became adept at building small robots to help him complete his tasks. He formed relationships with the little bots, but he found he missed the companionship of real humans. He would take small stints in the cryogenic chambers in order to prolong his life, so as to complete his mission of getting his friends and family to their new home. He didn't want to wake anyone to take over his duties and suffer the loneliness of space travel. But a long life with no one real to talk to is lacking.

With his knowledge of robotics, he took it upon himself to build an artificial human. Something that looked real. Something that felt real. Something that would make the unbearable loneliness go away.

He didn’t feel right copying the likeness of any members of the sleeping crew, so he modeled the robot on himself. By the time he was done, there “he” was, a perfect replica of Antoine himself. He named the robot Antoine 2.0, because who else was there to get confused? And as he grew older, it would be easier to remember his own name, he figured.

Well, years passed as they are won’t to do. He grew old and frail on the journey, but Antoine 2.0 remained young and spry, helping his creator to complete the tasks the old man’s bones could no longer handle.

As the old man lay dying, he asked his robotic companion to do him a favor. He wanted his remains to be scattered among the stars, the asteroids, and the comets they passed. He did not want to be buried on a planet he would never see, but instead live on in the vastness of space that had become his home. So when the day finally came, Antoine 2.0 sent his creator’s ashes out of the airlock and into the universe.

But the journey was not over. Antoine 2.0 carried on his creator’s duties for years and helped the crew arrive on their new home. As the ship grew close to the planet, the crew began to wake up. One by one they woke from their long sleep and travelled to the observation deck to see their new home. When they arrived, though, they found themselves in complete shock. There was Antoine, as lively and youthful as ever, waiting for them.

“How can this be?” They asked. “Surely, you would at the very least be an old, old man by now. It has been so long since we left Earth.”

Antoine 2.0 raised his hands slightly in a calming gesture and said, “Do not worry. I am here to send you a message of love and care from Antoine. I was created to help him complete his mission. I may look like him, but in truth, I am not him. For you see,” and with this he gestured towards the stars and space above their heads, “the real Antoine is in the comets.”",1,False,1569514782,Jokes,0,/r/Jokes/comments/d9lw0y/the_caretaker_of_a_generation_ship_was_on_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d9lw0y/the_caretaker_of_a_generation_ship_was_on_his/,d9lw0y,ZZiyan_11,

Human Life Explained,"On the first day, God created the dog and said, ""Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past.  For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years.""

The dog said, ""That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?""

And God saw it was good.

On the second day, God created the monkey and said, ""Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span.""

The monkey said, ""Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?""

And God, again saw it was good.

On the third day, God created the cow and said, ""You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years.""

The cow said, ""That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?""

And God agreed it was good.

On the fourth day, God created humans and said, ""Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years.""

But the human said, ""Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back,
the ten the monkey gave back,
and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?""

""Okay,"" said God, ""You asked for it.""

So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.

For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family.

For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. 

And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.

Trump has a heart attack and dies. He goes to Hell where the Devil is waiting for him.,"""I don't know what to do,"" says the Devil. ""You're on my list but I have no room for you. But you definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three people here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves.""
Trump thought that sounded pretty good so he agreed.

The devil opened the first room. In it was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty handed over and over and over, such was his fate in Hell.
""No!"" Trump said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day long.""

The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Tony Blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.
""No! I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day!"" commented Trump. 

The Devil opened a third door. In it, Trump saw Bill Clinton lying naked on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.

Trump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, ""Yeah, I can handle this.""

The more she talks about it the more excited she gets and she starts trying to talk her boyfriend into having one. after a while he gives in and lets her order him one.
The bartender brings the drink and puts the following on the bar - a salt shaker, a shot of Baileys and a shot of lime juice. The boyfriend looks at the items quizzically and the woman explains.
""First you put a bit of the salt on your tongue, next you drink the shot of Baileys and hold it in your mouth and finally you drink the lime juice""
So the boyfriend, trying to go along and please her, goes for it. He puts the salt on his tongue - SALTY BUT OK. He drinks the shot of Baileys - SMOOTH, RICH AND COOL, VERY PLEASANT - He thinks, this is OK. Finally he picks up the lime Juice and drinks it.

There's nothing worse than feeling vulnerable and emotionally related to an ongoing debate turned routine comedy. However, as an American loving life abroad I've been living on time-zone related news updates for more than 3 years. I awake to the international jokes our country has become representative of and backtrack daily to get to the actual story and then beyond. Its been years of media sensationalism perpetuated by the deliberate bipartisan, propaganda warfare on going in the US. We are now that international comedic-relief before the cute cat/dog/humane story of brevity. Whether you support Trump or not, I do not care at this moment because I will afford you the respect deserved to an opinion without arbitrarily downvoting or rudely commenting when I could begin honest discourse. It's just that *this specific thread* is a **JOKE subreddit**. That is its purpose. I was simply trying to bring that back.

Blonde joke that you never heard before,"After becoming very frustrated with the attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the young blonde declared, ""Well, then, maybe I'll just go out and catch my own alligator and get a pair of alligator shoes for free!'

The shopkeeper replied with a sly smile, ""Well, little lady, why don't you go give it a try?""

The blonde headed off to the swamp, determined to catch an alligator. Later in the day, the shopkeeper was driving home and spotted the young woman standing waist-deep in the murky water, shotgun in hand.

He saw a huge 9-foot gator swimming rapidly towards her. With lightning reflexes, the blonde took aim, shot the creature and hauled it up onto the slippery bank.

Nearby were 7 more dead gators all lying belly up. The shopkeeper watched in amazement as the blonde struggled with the gator. Then, rolling her eyes, she screamed in frustration........

3 women are out on the town for a girl's night.,"After 3 hours at the local bar, they are all completely hammered and finding a cab was difficult, so they all decided to walk home. After about 20 minutes they had to piss but no place was open as it was past 3AM however they found a cemetery that was discreet for them all to urinate. The First woman goes first by a tree and ruins her panties and throws them away, The Second one squats behind a bush but she had on really expensive underwear and did not want to ruin them and places them in her purse and uses leaves to clean up. The Third lady pees right by a wreath and uses a piece of paper to clean up.

&amp;#x200B;

The next morning, their 3 husbands are having coffee together talking about their wives coming home.

&amp;#x200B;

Husband 1: I have no idea what happened last night but my wife came home and she wasn't wearing her underwear...

Husband 2: Mine came home without her panties as well yet I found them hanging out of her purse

A duck walks into a pub,"A duck walks into a pub and orders a pint of beer and a ham sandwich.

The barman looks at him and says,

""Hang on! You're a duck.""

""I see your eyes are working,"" replies the duck.

""And you can talk!""
Exclaims the barman.

""I see your ears are working, too,""
Says the duck.

""Now if you don't mind, can I have my beer and my sandwich please?""

""Certainly, sorry about that,""

Says the barman as he pulls the duck's pint.

""It's just we don't get many ducks in this pub. What are you doing around this way?""

""I'm working on the building site across the road,"" Explains the duck.

""I'm a plasterer.""

The flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck and wants to learn more, but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it.

So, the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, bids the barman good day and leaves.

The same thing happens for two weeks.

Then one day the circus comes to town.

The ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him

""You're with the circus, aren't you? Well, I know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. He talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!""

""Sounds great!"" says the ringmaster, handing over his business card.

""Get him to give me a call.""

So the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says,

""Hey Mr Duck, I reckon I can line you up with a top job, paying really good money.""

""I'm always looking for the next job,""

Says the duck.

""Where is it?""

""At the circus,""

Says the barman.

""The circus?""

Repeats the duck.

""That's right,""

Replies the barman.

""The circus?""

The duck asks again.

""Yeah,"" the barman replies.

""With all the animals who live in cages, and performers who live in caravans?"" says the duck.

""Of course,"" the barman replies.

""And the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?"" persists the duck.

""That's right!"" says the barman.

The duck shakes his head in amazement, and says .. . ......

Forks and knives!"" The third brother, following the second brother’s lead, got a job at a candy store and learned to say, ""Goody, goody gum drops!"" Finally, the fourth brother opted to sit in front of the tv all day and from his favorite commercial learned to say, ""Plug it in, plug it in!"" 

One day the four brothers were walking down the road when they came across a dead woman laying on the side walk. A police officer runs up to them and asks, “What happened here?! Who killed this woman?!"" 

The first brother sang the only words he had learned, ""Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!"" 

The policeman then continues, ""O-okay. That was easy. Well, how did you kill her?' 

To which the second brother replied, ""Forks and knives, forks and knives!"" 

The officer, stunned, shouts,""Everyone on the ground, you're all under arrest!"" 

The third brother, knowing nothing else, says ""Goody, goody gum drops!""

The police officer can’t wrap his head around what he’s hearing and finally tells them bluntly, ""You people are disgusting, I hope they give you the electric chair!""

St. Peter not knowing what else to say tells the man, ""I am sorry but it is time for you to go to Hell...""  


So the man finds himself in the most miserable place anyone could ever imagine.  It stinks, there are cigarette butts everywhere, the toilets are all clogged and nasty dirty, there is smoke everywhere and it is really hard to breathe.  Wanting to just keep his mind off things the man decides to go to work.

He fixes the smell, picks all the cigarette butts up, unclogs and cleans all the toilets, and he figures out how to get rid of the smoke so everyone can breathe a little easier.  Generally, the guy has made Hell a better place to be.

God and Satan have a meeting later and Satan decides to bring this guy up during their meeting saying that he has made Hell a pretty damned good place to be.

Surprised, the young man reached for her and the rattling resumed. This time she thrashes about wildly and there are screams of passion.

Franz was reading his book on death row...,"It was the ‘storm of the century’. On death row, Franz was reading his religious texts, looking for God, even as the inmates of the neighbouring cells were having an explosive argument about who should get to shower first. ’14 days to execution’, Franz thought, as he physically and mentally trembled. If there were ever a time for divine interference, it was now. That was when everything went dark.

‘This must be a power shortage,’ Franz mused to himself. ‘Wait, the backup generators obviously aren’t working either, or maybe just not yet. Maybe the electric doors are unlocked?’ Optimistically, Franz pushed on his cell door, which did give way!

Adrenaline now coursing through his veins, Franz realised that this was it. He got to his feet and ran through multiple corridors, none of which had working doors. Then, he spotted a lone guard running up the corridor, obviously out of breath. With a quick punch and jab, the guard was down on the floor, and Franz snapped his neck with the adroitness of a practiced fighter and killer, which he was after all. The commotion in the rest of the prison, added to the noise of the rain, covered the noise generated by the quick melee.

Searching through the guard’s possessions, Franz was delighted to find not only a wallet, but car keys! After quickly donning the guard’s gear, he ran towards the exit of the prison unstopped by anyone, and drove to his freedom. 300 miles away and in a small town of different state, Franz finally stopped to get what he needed after abandoning the car in the deep woods and taking along a bag-pack. ‘They’ll never find me now,’ he reasoned. It was then that he saw an extremely elegant lady with flaxen hair, walking down the street.

Franz was tall, dark, handsome, and extremely charismatic. Knowing his strengths, he approached the lady, posing as a bag-packer. Over a short but sweet conversation, he convinced the lady, Elise, to let him stay the night at her place. Once the television came on in the morning though, bearing Franz’s mugshot and a ‘shoot on sight’ recommendation, it quickly dawned on Elise that she was harbouring an Eastern-European gangster who was also a wanted serial killer.

‘NO WAY!’ Elise shouted at Franz, as Franz begged her to give him a chance. Ordinarily this would have just meant one more dead body. But over the night, Franz realised that he really loved Elise. Besides, from a pragmatic point of view a dead body popping up in this town would be of no help to himself, especially when the police search was centred 300 miles away.

Using every last drop of his linguistic virtuosity, Franz told Elise the very sad story of a child in a family of gangsters, who was born solely to be a mere pawn in the web of crime lynchpins. He managed to convince Elise to harbour him for just a few days. Those few days turned into weeks, then months, and eventually years.

Using a stolen identity, Franz and Elise were able to build a new life together, and enjoy everything that normal couples would. They toured the alpine paradises of Switzerland, and the caverns of Sonora. They enjoyed Italian operas, and American soaps. They engaged in extreme sports, and watched spectator games. But the one thing they shared a particular partiality for was comedy, in all its forms.

After 13 years of sheer unadulterated bliss though, Elise was hit by the sudden discovery that she had late stage cancer, and only a few months to live. The first few days after the revelation were marked with intense anguish and bitterness for the couple. But as they slowly accepted Elise’s cruel fate, the couple were able to push forward and live their lives to the fullest, despite the impending tragedy. Gradually though, Elise’s energy waned, and the couple went from spending their time out rappelling and rock climbing, to spending never-ending nights in the ICU.

One night, as she was coughing up blood, Elise whispered laboriously to Franz, ‘I think this is it. I don’t think I’ll get past tonight. Can you get him to come?’

Franz fumbled for his mobile phone and made a quick phone call. Over the last few months, Franz had managed to get a famous comedian to promise to do a stand-up routine for just himself and Elise, and he was now redeeming the promise he had extracted. After all, humour was the one thing that he shared with Elise most profoundly, and both of them wanted to spend their last day together, enjoying what they loved most.

A mere 5 minutes later, there was a knock on the hospital door. A surprised Franz opened the door, and found himself staring at an entire SWAT team and down the barrels of their guns. In that moment, he knew the game was up. Instantly he fully felt the delayed tiredness of all the last few months.

‘Is it him?’ Elise mumbled from her bed quite hoarsely and inaudibly. And as the last 14 beautiful years flashed in his head, Franz tiredly replied:

Pay your bills,"Once upon a time lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts. Nick (an employee in the palace) obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 
One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague, David the physician, the King's chief doctor. David thought about this and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. Without pause, Nick readily agreed to the scheme.
The next day, David made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.
Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, David informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that, among all of the citizens of the kingdom, only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.
The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. David then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts.
The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and was hailed by the King and Queen as a hero.
Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found David demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick cared less knowing that David could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.
The next day, David slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick . . .

[OC] [Very long] It was the storm of the century...,"It was the ‘storm of the century’. And on death row, Franz was reading his religious texts, looking for God, even as the inmates of the neighbouring cells were having an explosive argument about who should get to shower first. ’14 days to execution’, Franz thought, as he physically and mentally trembled. If there were ever a time for divine interference, it was now. That was when everything went dark.

‘This must be a power shortage,’ Franz mused to himself. ‘Wait, the backup generators obviously aren’t working either, or maybe just not yet. Maybe the electric doors are unlocked?’ Optimistically, Franz pushed on his cell door, which did give way!

Adrenaline now coursing through his veins, Franz realised that this was it. He got to his feet and ran through multiple corridors, none of which had working doors. Then, he spotted a lone guard running up the corridor, obviously out of breath. With a quick punch and jab, the guard was down on the floor, and Franz snapped his neck with the adroitness of a practiced fighter and killer, which he was after all. The commotion in the rest of the prison, added to the noise of the rain, covered the noise generated by the quick melee.

Searching through the guard’s possessions, Franz was delighted to find not only a wallet, but car keys! After quickly donning the guard’s gear, he ran towards the exit of the prison unstopped by anyone, and drove to his freedom. 300 miles away and in a small town of different state, Franz finally stopped to get what he needed after abandoning the car in the deep woods and taking along a bag-pack. ‘They’ll never find me now,’ he reasoned. It was then that he saw an extremely elegant lady with flaxen hair, walking down the street.

Franz was tall, dark, handsome, and extremely charismatic. Knowing his strengths, he approached the lady, posing as a bag-packer. Over a short but sweet conversation, he convinced the lady, Elise, to let him stay the night at her place. Once the television came on in the morning though, bearing Franz’s mugshot and a ‘shoot on sight’ recommendation, it quickly dawned on Elise that she was harbouring an Eastern-European gangster who was also a wanted serial killer.

‘NO WAY!’ Elise shouted at Franz, as Franz begged her to give him a chance. Ordinarily this would have just meant one more dead body. But over the night, Franz realised that he really loved Elise. Besides, from a pragmatic point of view a dead body popping up in this town would be of no help to himself, especially when the police search was centred 300 miles away.

Using every last drop of his linguistic virtuosity, Franz told Elise the very sad story of a child in a family of gangsters, who was born solely to be a mere pawn in the web of crime lynchpins. He managed to convince Elise to harbour him for just a few days. Those few days turned into weeks, then months, and eventually years.

Using a stolen identity, Franz and Elise were able to build a new life together, and enjoy everything that normal couples would. They toured the alpine paradises of Switzerland, and the caverns of Sonora. They enjoyed Italian operas, and American soaps. They engaged in extreme sports, and watched spectator games. But the one thing they shared a particular partiality for was comedy, in all its forms.

After 13 years of sheer unadulterated bliss though, Elise was hit by the sudden discovery that she had late stage cancer, and only a few months to live. The first few days after the revelation were marked with intense anguish and bitterness for the couple. But as they slowly accepted Elise’s cruel fate, the couple were able to push forward and live their lives to the fullest, despite the impending tragedy. Gradually though, Elise’s energy waned, and the couple went from spending their time out rappelling and rock climbing, to spending never-ending nights in the ICU.

One night, as she was coughing up blood, Elise whispered laboriously to Franz, ‘I think this is it. I don’t think I’ll get past tonight. Can you get him to come?’

Franz fumbled for his mobile phone and made a quick phone call. Over the last few months, Franz had managed to get a famous comedian to promise to do a stand-up routine for just himself and Elise, and he was now redeeming the promise he had extracted. After all, humour was the one thing that he shared with Elise most profoundly, and both of them wanted to spend their last day together, enjoying what they loved most.

A mere 5 minutes later, there was a knock on the hospital door. A surprised Franz opened the door, and found himself staring at an entire SWAT team and down the barrels of their guns. In that moment, he knew the game was up. Instantly he fully felt the delayed tiredness of all the last few months.

‘Is it him?’ Elise mumbled from her bed quite hoarsely and inaudibly. And as the last 14 beautiful years flashed in his head, Franz tiredly replied:

“Certainly,” replies the assistant. “Would you like to listen before you buy it?”

He listens for a few moments and says to the assistant, “I’m terribly sorry, but I am the world’s leading expert on European wasps and this is not accurate at all. I don’t recognize any of those sounds. Are you sure this is the correct recording?”

The assistant checks the turntable, and replies that it is indeed European Vespidae Acoustics Volume 2. The assistant apologizes and lifts the needle onto the next track.

Again, the expert listens for a few moments and then says to the assistant, “No, this just can’t be right! I’ve been an expert in this field for 43 years and I still don’t recognize any of these sounds.”

"King Arthur, the Second","Once there was a brave and strong British man. He regularly went to the gym. 

However, one day, he suddenly lost his capabilities. He was upset when he couldn't even lift the lightest dumbbells with both of his hands. Feeling frustrated, he stormed out of the gym and kept his head lowered.

Along the way, he passed a construction sight when he caught sight of something. A sword, buried in the ground.

Being British, he knew the tale of King Arthur, and pulled the sword out. The task was completed easily by the man. Suddenly, he felt something surging through him, and he felt stronger again. On the end of the sword was a note. He decided to look at the note later, and he went back to the gym.

Sure enough, his abilities were back. He looked at the note, then dropped the sword while laughing.

Stolen money,"(Today I have for you my 6th grade joke)


An unworldly bloke had a stroke of good luck and won the lottery. Everyone told him he could have anything he wanted now, so what did he want? He had never been with a woman so he set out in his car, rolled down the window and said, “Hey, baby...want to have sex?” She yells, “Get lost creep!” He repeats this a few time with the same results. He decides on a different tactic. 

He takes out the money and spreads it all across the dash of his car and circles back around to the first woman and asks again, “Hey, baby...wanna have sex?” “Get lo....” she sees all that money so she hops in. He asks if they can have sex now but she says it’s not dark enough to drive down an alley, so he does. “Is it dark enough?” It wasn’t so she had him drive down farther until it was very dark. 

“Can we have sex now?” 

“Not yet but take my pants off and see what’s down there”. He takes her pants off but it’s too dark to see so he takes out his lighter and turns it on. While he’s doing this, she opens her purse and begins raking the money in it. 

“Boy, you sure do have a lot of hair down here!” She just mumbles uh-huh and keeps raking  the money in her purse. “Can you pee through all this hair??!” “Uh-huh” while finally getting all the money in her purse.

A convent of Catholic nuns receives a letter saying the Pope himself will be visiting in just a few days,"They are all very excited and nervous.  Mothers Mary, Agnes, and Isadore take it upon themselves to prepare the convent to receive His Holiness and plan a simple but delicious meal of fresh caught fish from the local lake with herbs and vegetables from their own garden.

Agnes goes to the local lake and casts her bait and within seconds she feels a mighty tug on the line.  She reels in a beautiful fish every color of the rainbow!  Surely this is a sign of god's grace and love, and it would be a perfect fish to serve to the Pope.  The trouble is Agnes nor any of the other nuns had ever seen such a fish before and had no idea what it was or how to prepare it so they put it on ice and took it to the local village which had many experience fishermen.

When they entered a fishing shop with their catch they asked the shopkeeper what they had caught.  He removed his sunglasses and said ""Oh goodness that's very rare!  I haven't seen one in years.  This fish is called a Sunnavabitch and is absolutely beautiful when prepared correctly!""

They thanked the fisherman for his advice and sought the services of a local chef for his input on how to properly prepare the Sunnavabitch.  He said ""It must be treated gently!  Lightly steamed until the flesh is just tender.  This will make a fine meal for His Holiness!""

The following day Agnes left the fish with Mary and Isadore to begin cooking while she gathered fresh produce from around the Convent.  Mary took special care to clean and gut the fish, leaving not a single scale or bone.  Isadore took Agnes' herbs and vegetables and cooked them with the fish.  No sooner had the meal come together than they heard a knock on the door and it was the pope himself!  They graciously welcomed him in to their table and proudly placed the fish before him. 

They prayed and ate the meal as the Pope praised every bite, thanking God and the nuns for such incredible bounty.

When finished the Pope said ""This-a meal was-a so good!  But I have-a never had such a fish in-a all of my days.  Who made-a this?""

Wanting to speak properly Agnes stepped forward and said ""Well your Holiness, I caught the Sunnavabitch, Mary cleaned the Sunnavabitch an Isadore cooked the Sunnavabitch.  We are grateful it was to your liking""

Grandpa was summoned for an audit.,"The IRS decides to audit Grandpa, and summons him to the IRS office. The IRS auditor was not surprised when Grandpa showed up with his attorney.

The auditor said, ‘Well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. I’m not sure the IRS finds that believable.’

‘I’m a great gambler, and I can prove it,’ says Grandpa. ‘How about a demonstration?’

The auditor thinks for a moment and says, ‘Okay. Go ahead. ‘

Grandpa says, ‘I’ll bet you a thousand dollars that I can bite my own eye.’

The auditor thinks a moment and says, ‘It’s a bet.’

Grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. The auditor’s jaw drops.

Grandpa says, ‘Now, I’ll bet you two thousand dollars that I can bite my other eye.’

The auditor can tell Grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.

Grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. The stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with Grandpa’s attorney as a witness. He starts to get nervous.

‘Want to go double or nothing?’ Grandpa asks ‘I’ll bet you six thousand dollars that I can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.’

The auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.

Grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.

The auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win.

But Grandpa’s own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.

‘Are you okay?’ the auditor asks.

‘Not really,’ says the attorney. ‘This morning, when Grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.’",9376,False,1568314813,Jokes,140,/r/Jokes/comments/d3cljq/grandpa_was_summoned_for_an_audit/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d3cljq/grandpa_was_summoned_for_an_audit/,d3cljq,menarlad,"A version of an old joke.

"A friend told me this, and he might have got it from reddit so this might be a repost but here it goes [Long]","3 best friends decide to travel to an lonely little island somewhere near the Bahamas in the hopes of having a relaxing camping trip, for old time’s sake.

They arrive by water plane, and the pilot informs them that he’ll be returning to pick them up the next day. The men, happy to finally be alone start sunbathing, talking about their lives (most of the talk being complaints), and simply having a good time.

One of the guys decides, he wants to build a sandcastle, because, why the hell not. He starts digging up some sand, and asks his best friends to help him out. They start digging, and finally, one of them exclaims: “Guys! look! Its a lamp!” The guys looked at each other and instantly knew what to do: all three of them simultaneously gave the lamp three rubs.

Suddenly *poof* a genie came out of the bottle! The three guys felt like this trip just couldn’t get any better. 

The genie, in the most Will Smith voice possible says: “you three, you have freed me! I shall give each one of you three wishes as a sign of my gratitude!”

The first guy instantly responds: “i want health for myself, and my entire family.” And the genie grants his wish.

The second guy responds: “i want the same thing, seems like a good idea. However, if you could add upon that that all current illnesses, genetic or otherwise would disappear, it would be great.” The genie replies “yeahhh sure” and *poof* his wish is granted

The third guy said he needed a while to think. After about 30 minutes, he exclaimed: “ive got it! I want my right hand to spin clockwise until I die!” The genie, dumbfounded, asks “are you sure?” And the third man simply said “yes, 100%” and his wish was granted.

The first guy then said  “its my turn again! I want to be wealthy enough to buy anything i’d ever want, and i want to see proof of it.” The genie granted his wish and *poof* a phone appeared in his hand showing the first guy’s bank statement. $10 Billion dollars have been deposited on his bank account.

The second guy, agreeing to his logic, said “i also want money. But i’d rather have it in physical goods, like houses, or gold bars” *poof* another phone appears showing a page with all the real estate and investments that the second guy now owned, all worth around 10 billion dollars too.

The third guy, having thought about this thoroughly throughout the last few minutes, simply said “i would like my left hand to spin counter-clockwise until i die” the genie thinks to himself, this man MUST have a plan with all this. And simply grants his wish.

Back to the first guy. He now wished for him, and all his loved ones to be immortal, and to stay at the age of 35 until they decide, on their own terms, that its time for them to leave this planet. The genie, granted his wish just like all the other ones before him.

The second guy, who we now know is the least creative of the bunch mutters nothing else but “same”. And the genie grants his wish too.

The third guy however, was still thinking. His left and right hand spinning in opposite directions he shouted: “i want my head to rock back and forth as if i was on a rock concert until i die!” At this point the genie didn’t even care anymore and just said “aight man, whatever”.

The men, all happy with their wishes decided to meet up again in ten years to discuss their lives.

They met up in Monaco, one coming on his yacht, the second on his private jet, both with beautiful wives and kids, and sat down at a table in the most expensive restaurant in town.  The third guy then arrived, his hands still spinning and his head still rocking back and forth, almost knocking over the table. He apologised and they began talking about their lives. The first and second guy are so happy with their new lives that they have tears streaming down their cheeks. They talked about the wonderful houses theyve built, the investments theyve made, and the vacations theyve had. Suddenly they realised that the third guy hasnt said a word. They ask him, “what about you? Hows your life? How did your wishes work out for you?”

A man from Turkey decided to try to make some money on the side,"He loved music but hated the way that festivals always kept the port-a-potties either disgusting or didn't have enough for the crowd.  His idea? Put up a pole that people could go to, with a catch basin at the bottom that could be emptied with a pump.  The pole would give them something to aim for, and multiple people could use it at once if they weren't squeamish.  It didn't work for #2s, but it helped the lines.


He tested the idea at a bunch of festivals and it seemed to work out well, until he booked a gig in Russia.  Problem there was it got so cold that the urine was freezing to the pole and closing to the catch basin, causing overflows and sanitary hazards.  The man came up with a solution, which involved placing a heating element inside the pole so it couldn't freeze.  He also decided to make anyone who's it sign a simple one-page waiver removing any liability from him in the event of an accident. 


He debuted it to great fanfare at good next festival, where it worked well enough; The heating element got a little too hot, so often times the pole would sizzle when someone peed on it.  


Luckily, the inebriated festival goers thought this was hilarious, and before long, people couldn't stop talking about the on-the-side, one form, frying Turkish pee-pole heater",0,False,1568288196,Jokes,0,/r/Jokes/comments/d36l3o/a_man_from_turkey_decided_to_try_to_make_some/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d36l3o/a_man_from_turkey_decided_to_try_to_make_some/,d36l3o,UYScutiPuffJr,

The Golden Dildo,"(Sorry if you guys have read this already lol.)

This married man is a laywer and is fairly smart. He has to go out of town for two weeks and knows his wife may go to cheat on him during the time he's away.

So, the man goes to the most renouned sex shop he can find and he walks up to the shop keeper. ""Sir, I need something amazing that will keep my wife busy while I'm out of town. As spectacular as it gets, please.""

So the shop keeper pulls out this Golden Dildo and explains, ""You just tell it where to go, and it'll do exactly that."" The man, pleased with his find, buys it and goes home to his wife. He explains to her how to use it and heads off on his business trip.

After a few days, the wife gets a little frisky and finally puts it to use. One orgasm, two, three, four... And she can't get it to stop. So, she gets in her car and starts making her way to the hospital. She's swerving all over the road as the dildo was going to town, so eventually, a cop pulls her over.

""Ma'am, why are you driving all over the road? Have you been drinking tonight?""

Some hours later, Holmes wakes up and nudges his faithful friend. “Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see.”

Mailman is making his rounds on his very last day of work. After 25 years on the same route the day had finally come. He was a good mailman and well liked.

All was going well until he got to the Smith residence.," When he came to the door and was about to deliver the letters, Mrs.  Smith opened the door in a sexy lingerie holding a plate of cookies and  invited him in. The mailman, not wanting to be rude took a few cookies,  stepped inside and said thank you. As he was about to leave, she said ""  oh no, we're not done. I asked my husband and he said i could give you a  final gift of my own"", and off came her clothes with a come here grin.  Again, not wanting to be rude the mailman took up Mrs.Smith on her  offer. This was his last day after all and her husband said it was OK.  As they finished up she walked him to the door, she gave him a crisp new  1 dollar bill and kissed him on the cheek. The mailman, now completely  confused said, Mrs.Smith i get the cookies, the kiss and although a  little spontaneous I actually get the sex thing too. I don't however,  understand the 1 dollar bill. Mrs.Smith looked at him and said that was  hubby's idea. I told him i had made you cookies for your retirement and  he said ""fuck the mailman, give him a dollar, he'll be happy"".  So i  did.

"A guy goes into a bar and says to the bartender, ""If I show you the most amazing thing you've ever seen, will you let me drink for free tonight?""","The bartender says, ""Let me see and I'll consider it.""

So the guy reaches into his bag and pulls out a miniature piano and a hamster. The hamster sits in front of the piano and starts playing. And not just banging out ""Chopsticks"", the hamster is plays Chopin, some ragtime, and even some rock and roll.

After a few minutes the bartender says, ""Okay, I am impressed. You can drink for free tonight.""

As the bartender is pouring the guy a drink, the guy says, ""Hey, if I show you something even more amazing, will you let me drink for free for a month?""

The bartender says, ""Okay, but this had better be pretty spectacular."" So the guy reaches into his bag again and pulls out a microphone and a frog. The frog sits in front of the microphone and begins singing along with the hamster playing the piano.

The bartender says, ""Okay, I'm impressed. You can drink here for free for a month.""

As all of this has been going on, another customer at the end of the bar has been watching. He walks over and says, ""I'm a theater producer, and I'd like to buy that frog and put him in a show. Will you sell it to me for $500?"" The guy says no. ""$1000?"". The guy still refuses. ""Okay, will you sell me the frog for $5000?""

So the guy agrees, and gives the producer the frog for $5000. As the producer is leaving, the bartender says to the guy, ""I can't believe you sold the frog! Surely it was worth more than $5000!""

Bob left for work,"Bob left work one Friday evening.

The passenger thinks it over for a minute. He really has to go. So he does just what the driver suggested. Hangs his ass out the open window and bombs away.

The second hiker, wiping the shit off his face says, ""Strong tobacco?! You see the jaws on that guy!?""

If you weren't paying to exist, youd be spending al your time working to survive (hunting and gathering).  You are paying with time.

However, with society, we can make enough money to pay for things in much less time."

They had been facing each other across a pathway for a hundred years. 

One day an angel comes down from the sky and with a single gesture, brings the two to life.

The angel tells them, ""As a reward for being so patient through a hundred blazing summers and dismal winters, you have been given life for thirty minutes to do what you've wished to do the most.""

He looks at her. She looks at him. They go running behind the shrubbery. 

The angel waits patiently as the bushes rustle and giggling ensues. After fifteen minutes, the two return, out of breath and laughing. 

The angel looks at his watch. ""Um, you have fifteen minutes left… would you care to do it again?""

"A Pessimist, an Optimist, and a Literalist go Hunting","An optimist, a pessimist, and a literalist go hunting together. They make camp, and agree that one will go hunting while two stay at camp.

The pessimist asks to go first thinking that there won't be anything to hunt and wants to get it out of the way. They leave camp. Many hours later they return with a young deer.

""Wow! Exclaimed the others, ""How did you get that?!""

""Well"", the pessimist offered gloomily, ""I found some tracks, and after walking for ever and ever, I saw the deer and Boom! I shot him.""

""That doesn't sound so bad!"" Exclaimed the optimist. And with that the optimist left camp to go hunt.

Not too long after they return dragging a ten point buck behind them.

""That's amazing!"" Cried the others, ""How on earth did you manage that?""

""Just like the pessimist"", smiled the optimist, ""I found some tracks, followed them, and Boom! I shot myself a ten point buck!""

""This is going to be easy."" Stated the literalist. ""You've both shown exactly what I need to do, so I'm bound to have the best kill off all!"" And with that, the literalist left camp.

Hours passed. Night fell, and morning came, all with no sign of the literalist. The other two became extremely worried and agreed to go look for them. But just before they left, the literalist appeared.

They dragged themselves along the ground, beaten and bloodied, clinging to life.

""What happened?!"" Cried the others.

of Knights and Squires,"There were three medieval kingdoms on the shores of a lake. There was an island in the middle of the lake, which the kingdoms had been fighting over for years. Finally, the three kings decided that they would send their knights out to do battle, and the winner would take the island. The night before the battle, the knights and their squires pitched camp and readied themselves for fight.

The first kingdom had 12 knights, and each knight had five squires, all of them busily preparing for battle. The second kingdom had 20 knights, and each knight had 10 squires. Everyone at that camp was also busy preparing for battle. At the camp of the third kingdom, there was only one knight with his lone squire. This squire took a large pot and hung it from a looped rope in a tall tree. He busied himself preparing the meal, while the knight polished his own armor.

When the hour of the battle came, the three kingdoms sent their squires out to fight, as this was too trivial a matter for the knights to join in. The battle raged, and when the dust cleared, the only person left was the lone squire from the third kingdom. He had defeated the squires from the other two kingdoms.

This proves that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.",4,False,1568218219,Jokes,1,/r/Jokes/comments/d2sjs4/of_knights_and_squires/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d2sjs4/of_knights_and_squires/,d2sjs4,DooleyMTV,

The doctor suggested for a skin graft, but unfortunately, the doctor had to inform her that they couldn't use any skin from her body because she was so thin. The husband then offered to donate some of his skin for the skin graft.

However, the doctor said that the only suitable skin was from his buttocks. They accepted, but requested that no one be told of this, because after all this was a very delicate matter!

After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the wife's new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever did before! All her friends and relatives just ranted and raved at her youthful beauty! 

One day, she was finally alone with her husband &amp; she wanted to thank him for what he did. She said, ""Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me! There is no way I could ever repay you!”

"A young blonde girl in her late teens, wanting to earn some extra money for the summer, decided to hire herself out as a ""handy woman"" and started canvassing a nearby well-to-do neighborhood."," She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had  
 any odd jobs for her to do. ""Well, I guess I could use somebody to paint the  
 porch"" he said.  ""How much will you charge me?""  


Delighted, the girl quickly responded,  
 ""How about $50?""  
 

The man agreed and told her that the paint and brushes and everything she would need were in the garage.  
 

The man's wife, hearing the conversation, said to her husband, ""Does   
 she realize that our porch goes ALL the way around the house?""  
 

""That's a bit cynical, isn't it?"" he responded.  
 

The wife replied, ""You're right. I guess I'm starting to believe all those  
 dumb blonde jokes.""  
 

A few hours later the blonde came to the door to collect her money.  
 

""You're finished already??"" the startled husband asked.  
 

""Yes,"" the blonde replied, ""and I even had paint left over so I gave it two  
 coats.""  
 

Impressed, the man reached into his pocket for the $50 and handed it to her along with a $10 tip.

The adventures of Farty Bart,"Bart was a regular fellow, quite charming actually. But he farted often than most.


Bart has obatined that sweet sweet yes from the girl of his dream, they agreed to a date on his now girlfriend's house.


They were eating, chatting, laughing, until had the sudden urge to fart. Of course like any decent gentleman he chose not to embarrass himself and hold it in. But he failed and it came out almost instantly.


""Max, get out of here right now!"" His girlfriend said. Max was her dog that was sitting just beside their table.


Bart was relieved that she thought it was the dog that farted! Looks like he got away this time.

Now Max the obedient boy that he is, went straight under the table, girlfrien.. let's just call her Annie from now, just ignored him and continued on their date.


About 5 minutes have passed and Bart had the urge to fart again. He's not called Farty Bart for nothing.


This time it was one of those farts that are labeled ""silent but deadly"" Bart wanted to be sneaky and just let it out without a sound, praying Annie wouldn't notice.

Again, he failed.


Annie noticed the absurd smell immediately.


Again she said ""Max, get out of here i said!"" 

Again Max didn't bat an eye and just stayed there.


Bart, again relieved that he got away because of his now best friend Max, is... well about to fart again.


This fart was one of those ""big ones"" you know the one the you know is gonna be bad... like really bad


He tried to hold it in, his face began to turn red, he sweated a lot, he was like having this spiritual battle... withs fart.


And then alas, he failed.


The fart came out in all of it's glory, probably filling the whole room!

Now Annie was full of it, she couldn't stand it, Max had to go.

Enjoy your upvote.|I promise I’m not being a “well achually” guy. I legitimately thought this was neat when I learned it.

“Small arms” actually means any gun that could be reasonably carried and shot by a soldier. The us military defines it as any bullet smaller than .60 caliber (if I remember correctly).

So any type of gun like an AK47, a handgun, a rifle, etc. are all considered “small arms”. Small arms are distinct from things like rocket launchers, grenades, antiaircraft guns, etc.

For example, if you were a helicopter pilot, you might notice small arms fire. That may not be a big deal if you’re far away, but larger ordinance would concern you.|Would have preferred the pun:

Captain America and a Grammar Nazi are working for a diamond mine,"Captain America and a Grammar Nazi are working for a diamond mine, and they have a meeting with a consultant. The consultant tells them that the mine is flooding the market with too many cheap diamonds, and their income is dropping as a result.

Captain America says, ""Well, if you're correct, I will order that we mine less diamonds then.""

The Grammar Nazi corrects Cap, saying, ""Mine fewer.""

So Cap puches the Nazi in the jaw.

The old lady and the bank,"An elderly woman walked into the Bank of England one morning with a bag full of money. She wanted to open a savings account and insisted on talking to the Chairman of the Bank because, she said, she had a lot of money.

After many lengthy discussions (after all, the customer is always right) an employee took the elderly woman to the Chairman's office.

The chairman of the Bank asked her how much she wanted to deposit. She placed her purse on his desk and replied, ""£165,000"". The president was curious and asked her how she had been able to save so much money. The elderly woman replied that she made bets.

The chairman was surprised and asked, ""What kind of bets?""

The elderly woman replied, ""Well, I bet you      £25,000  that your testicles are square.""

The chairman started to laugh and told the woman that it was impossible to win a bet like that.

The woman never batted an eye. She just looked at the chairman and said, ""Would you like to take my bet?""

""Certainly"", replied the Chairman. ""I bet you £25,000 that my testicles are not square.""

""Done"", the elderly woman answered. ""But given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind I would like to come back at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness."" ""No problem"", said the chairman of the Bank confidently.


That night, the chairman became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.

The next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the chairman's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the £25,000 bet made the day before that the chairman's testicles were square.

The chairman confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. Then the elderly woman asked him to drop his trousers etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.

The chairman was happy to oblige.

The elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the chairman if she could touch them. ""Of course"", said the chairman. ""Given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.""

The elderly woman did so with a little smile.

Suddenly the chairman noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. He asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, ""Oh, it's probably because I bet him £100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning I would be holding the balls of the Chairman of the Bank of England !""",30,False,1567096004,Jokes,2,/r/Jokes/comments/cx37fa/the_old_lady_and_the_bank/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cx37fa/the_old_lady_and_the_bank/,cx37fa,transparentword,Talk about long|Awesome!

A boy makes money from his Mom's lover,"A housewife takes a lover during the day, while her husband is at work.

Unknown to her, her 9 year old son was hiding in the closet. Her husband came home unexpectedly, so she hide her lover in the closet.

A lifeguard is making his rounds on the beach when he hears a woman crying,"

He looks around to locate this source when he sees a woman with no arms and no legs sobbing on her towel. He approaches the woman and asks her what’s wrong. In between tears she replies, “I’m just so lonely. No one would come to the beach with me. So here I am, just a pathetic girl alone at the beach. I’ve never even been hugged before!” 

The lifeguard quickly reaches down to pick her up and gives her a great big hug. After setting her down, he says “There you go, now you’ve been hugged!”  The girl gets a huge smile on her face and her crying finally subsides. 

“Now before I get back to my stand, is there anything else I can help you with?” Asked the lifeguard.  A little smirk falls over the girls face as she says, “Well, I’ve also never been kissed before either...” 

The lifeguard blushes before leaning down, picking the girl up, and planting a huge kiss on the girls face and says “There you go, now you’ve been kissed!”  After he sets her down for the second time the girl is smiling ear to ear.  

“Alright, I REALLY have to finish my shift now, is there anything else I can do for you?” The lifeguard said one final time. The girl shyly clears her throat. “Well... while you’re at it...I’ve never been fucked before...”

A man dies and finds himself in an elevator,"He did expect a light at the end of the tunnel and all that, but he decides to see where things are going. Pretty soon, the destination of his elevator-ride is showing up on the display: ""Hell"" 

""Well"", the man thinks, ""I've had a good life. Fair's fair I guess."" 

The elevator opens and to his surprise hell isn't all fire and brimstone - it's a lush meadow with a pleasant blue sky and a small man in a white suit waiting for him, a beaming smile on his face. 

""Excuse me"", the man asks, ""I think I'm at the wrong place."" 

""No, no, I assure you, this is alright"", the man in the white suit says. ""This is indeed hell. And yes, I am the Devil."" 

The man is surprised but decides not to question it. Instead he asks: ""Can I have a look around?"" 

""Feel free"", the Devil encourages him. 

So the man walks around and finds hell to be rather pleasant. People sitting at swimming pools, laughing, talking, enjoying what seems to be the best food afterlife has to offer. But after a while, he notices a huge wall in the distance. Curious, he approaches and finds that the wall seems to be stretching infinitely in both directions. He follows it for a while and eventually spots a crack which he looks through. 

On the other side, it's hell in the worst sense: Fire is everywhere. People are screaming in agonizing pain as red-hot hooks are pierced through their skin. They are boiled alive, every bone in their body gets broken and demons of all shapes and sizes laugh at their pain. Struck with horror, the man turns around to run but freezes as he sees the Devil standing behind him.

The Missing Gravy Ladle,"John invited his mother over for dinner. During the meal, his mother couldn’t help noticing how beautiful John’s roommate was. She had long been suspicious of a relationship between John and his roommate and this only made her more curious.

Over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between John and the roommate than met the eye. ….

Reading his mom’s thoughts, John volunteered, “I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you, Julie and I are just roommates.”

About a week later, Julie came to John and said, “Ever since your mother came to dinner, I’ve been unable to find the beautiful silver gravy ladle. “You don’t suppose she took it, do you?” Julie said,

“Well, I doubt it, but I’ll write her a letter just to be sure.”

So he sat down and wrote: “Dear Mother, I’m not saying you ‘did’ take a gravy ladle from my house, and I’m not saying you ‘did not’ take a gravy ladle. But the fact remains that one has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.”

Several days later, John received a letter from his mother which read: “Dear Son, I’m not saying that you ‘do’ sleep with Julie, and I’m not saying that you ‘do not’ sleep with Julie. But the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the gravy ladle by now.

The caretaker of a generation ship was on his death bed,"This is a repost.  The original writer was u/atokachase

Many years before, Jacques had helped place all his friends and family into cryogenic sleep. He was a young man then and they all knew that he would likely be long dead by the time they reached their destination. They said their tearful goodbyes and drifted off to sleep.

In the years he spent alone on the ship, he became adept at building small robots to help him complete his tasks. He formed relationships with the little bots, but he found he missed the companionship of real humans. He would take small stints in the cryogenic chambers in order to prolong his life, so as to complete his mission of getting his friends and family to their new home. He didn't want to wake anyone to take over his duties and suffer the loneliness of space travel. But a long life with no one real to talk to is lacking.

With his knowledge of robotics, he took it upon himself to build an artificial human. Something that looked real. Something that felt real. Something that would make the unbearable loneliness go away.

He didn’t feel right copying the likeness of any members of the sleeping crew, so he modeled the robot on himself. By the time he was done, there “he” was, a perfect replica of Jacques himself. He named the robot Jacques 2.0, because who else was there to get confused? And as he grew older, it would be easier to remember his own name, he figured.

Well, years passed as they are wont to do. He grew old and frail on the journey, but Jacques 2.0 remained young and spry, helping his creator to complete the tasks the old man’s bones could no longer handle.

As the old man lay dying, he asked his robotic companion to do him a favor. He wanted his remains to be scattered among the stars, the asteroids, and the comets they passed. He did not want to be buried on a planet he would never see, but instead live on in the vastness of space that had become his home. So when the day finally came, Jacques 2.0 sent his creator’s ashes out of the airlock and into the universe.

But the journey was not over. Jacques 2.0 carried on his creator’s duties for years and helped the crew arrive on their new home. As the ship grew close to the planet, the crew began to wake up. One by one they woke from their long sleep and travelled to the observation deck to see their new home. When they arrived, though, they found themselves in complete shock. There was Jacques, as lively and youthful as ever, waiting for them.

“How can this be?” They asked. “Surely, you would at the very least be an old, old man by now. It has been so long since we left Earth.”

Jacques 2.0 raised his hands slightly in a calming gesture and said, “Do not worry. I am here to send you a message of love and care from Jacques. I was created to help him complete his mission. I may look like him, but in truth, I am not him. For you see,” and with this he gestured towards the stars and space above their heads, “the real Jacques is in the comets.”",2,False,1567048553,Jokes,2,/r/Jokes/comments/cwv9x7/the_caretaker_of_a_generation_ship_was_on_his/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cwv9x7/the_caretaker_of_a_generation_ship_was_on_his/,cwv9x7,Digaddog,Since this is a repost I don't feel right taking the karma for myself.

Schlock,"So there’s a Jewish woman who lives alone in an apartment flat with her dog and cat. The neighbors are out of town. It’s the middle of the day and there’s a knock at the door. She answers the door and it’s Jehovah’s Witness.

The man says, “Hey, want a Bible?”

To which she says, “No, besides I’m Jewish.”

She closes the door, only to open it again so she can leave to go water the neighbors’ plants. You see, the neighbors are a husband and wife couple that went away to Michigan to help cure the husband’s erectile dysfunction—that is after the plants didn’t work. They went to Michigan due to its uncanny resemblance with the husband’s penis—floppy, disfigured. Unfortunately, the neighbors’ plants also resembled the husband’s penis—lifeless, dry—so the woman called the neighbors to inform them that their plants were dead.

“We’ll be there,” said the wife.

Later that night, there was a knock at the door; it was the pizza guy.

“You must be mistaken I did not order pizza, besides it’s not Kosher,” says the woman.

“No, you’re the one who’s mistaken, because I have a nice, juicy breadstick right here,” says the pizza guy.

The woman closes the door and goes to bed. She makes a mental note to call the police in the morning. Before, she’s done with the mental note, there’s another knock at the door, but before she can get up she is raped by her dog.

Just then, the cat gets up to open the door; it’s Jehovah’s Witness again. The Witness sells the cat a Bible for a dollar ninety-nine, then looks past the door to see the woman getting raped by the dog.

He is nothing short of shocked as he says, “Hey, is that woman getting raped.”

The cat says, “No, she’s getting raped by a dog.”

The Bible salesman says, “Well, if that’s the case, I want to know if she wants a Bible.”

“Oh sure,” says the cat, “but the dog doesn’t want one.”

So the cat buys another Bible—this time for two ninety-nine, because that’s how religion works. The Jehovah’s Witness Bible salesman leaves, and the cat leaves the door open in case the pizza he ordered comes by.

Just then, the neighbors are coming back from their trip. As they walk down the hall, they notice that the door is open, so they check out what’s going on.

They look inside, the husband turns to his wife and says, “Honey, I think I’m cured.”

Not long after the incident, the neighbors had hastily divorced, and the woman had been moved to a trauma center in Michigan. Her therapist chose Michigan because he felt it was least likely to remind her of a dog’s penis. As for the dog, he was put down, and then he was killed. The cat went on to host a successful radio adaptation of the Bible funded by the local Kingdom Hall. As for the pizza guy, he turned out to be a sex offender.

Soon the story of the woman who was raped by a dog spread all across the media. Eventually, the DailyMail claimed the dog was in fact a German Shepherd, thus explaining its motives. The ADL subsequently set up a GoFundMe for the woman.

PETA filed a lawsuit in damages for the dog's death. However, the suit was dismissed after the court failed to determine whether the dog actually died or whether he escaped to Argentina under an assumed identity. Mossad set out a doghunt for the dog (codename: Hundler).

After ten years, they found him living in a huge mansion of a Pakistani town. Netanyahu proudly walked out in front of the news cameras and boldly announced, ""Ladies and gentlemen, it's Asian eat dog world. Today, the Jews are the Asians."" He was widely criticized for those comments.

Still, after the whole debacle was over, questions lingered. Like, how did Hundler escape if the vets at the Ausland Animal Hospital claimed they killed/euthanized him? Multiple theories arose.

1. The vets were dog sympathizers and staged the incident using a look-a-like, that way they could have their own independent commonwealth stolen from the Arabs.
2. The Ausland Animal Hospital never had any gas chambers, and the story about how they euthanized dogs was a hoax.
3. The dog had some good ideas (e.g. not raping the cat).
4. God's will.

However, some mysteries are actually meant to be mysterious.

Bill gates dies,"He dies and meets God. God tells him, “Now, Bill, you lived an extraordinary life. The products you made helped many people. However, there were also some debacles like Windows 95. I’m unsure whether to send you to Heaven and Hell. This is why, I’ve decided that for the first time in eternity, I am going to let you choose.”

Bill Gates replies, “That will do just fine. Just take me to Heaven and Hell and I can choose for myself.” God obliges. First they visit Heaven. Heaven is beautiful, a true sight to behold. Bill is amazed. There is every type of food imaginable, and beautiful women everywhere! However, he notices that there is no wine or alcohol. He asks God why this is. God tells him, “My son, it is seen as a sin to consume alcohol, and after all, this is heaven.”Bill thinks about this and decides it makes sense, although he is clearly disappointed. 

Four hours in, and Bill is getting bored, so he decides to start chatting up a woman. He talks to her a little bit and asks if she wants to go back to his place. She gasps and says, “Absolutely not! This is the Lord’s Palace! Sex before marriage is prohibited here!” 

Bill is quite annoyed at this point and decides he has had it with Heaven. He finds God and tells him, “God, I want to see Hell.” God willingly acquiesces. He snaps his fingers and suddenly, they appear in Hell. Bill looks around and sees copious amount of alcohol flowing in rivers. He realizes that women, even more beautiful than the ones in Heaven are leading men back to their homes. Bill, without thinking twice says, “I want to go to Hell!” God acquiesces. 

Two weeks pass. 

God decides to check on how Bill is doing. He goes down to Hell to check on him. When he gets there he finds Bill horribly tortured and nailed to a massive cross. Bill, upon seeing God, screams, “How the hell could you do this to me? Hell is nothing like you showed me! I have been tortured horribly since I have been here and I haven’t had a speck of alcohol or sex!” God smiles and replies, “Bill, I never lied to you! This is Hell! That was just a free trial!”",8,False,1567039030,Jokes,11,/r/Jokes/comments/cwtho7/bill_gates_dies/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cwtho7/bill_gates_dies/,cwtho7,Preebie,"Why Bill Gates?|Windows 95 was not a reason to send Gates to hell.

There was once an old man who loved telling jokes,"After a while, he decided that he wanted to share his jokes with the entire town. So every week he’d write down a new joke on posters and place them in as many places as possible. One day, however, he put up a joke that someone didn't like, and in the middle of the night, they tore every single joke down. The next day, the man went around town and saw all of his jokes on the ground, causing him to into extreme depression, and for a while, refused to leave his house.

Eventually, he managed to get back on his feet. While he was walking around, he noticed that his same joke was put back up in all of his usual spots. Later, a former criminal noticed the old man and introduced himself as the guy who replaced all of the posters.

Stunned at the revelation, the old man asked “Why would a person like you help me at one of the lowest points of my life?”

To which the ex-con replied “I think your jokes are hilarious, and after not seeing it up for two days, thought it would be good karma to do a repost.”",8,False,1567035382,Jokes,0,/r/Jokes/comments/cwsscj/there_was_once_an_old_man_who_loved_telling_jokes/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cwsscj/there_was_once_an_old_man_who_loved_telling_jokes/,cwsscj,Epicface227,
A New Life,"Haruki Ita, a Japanese man with gender dysphoria had recently left Japan after fully transitioning to start a new life as a woman.

First, she tried moving to Canada. With its liberal social policies, and accepting populace, it seemed the perfect place. But the very first night in the hotel, she made a call to the manager to request additional towels, and the call ended with ""Have a good night, Mr. Ita."" Taking that as a sign that Canada was not the place for her, she booked a flight to leave early the next morning.

So she tried going to the United States, which had made some strides recently in LGBT rights. But let's be honest, the US is kind of a dumpster fire right now, what with the Nazis and such, so she moved on.

Finally she flew to Cuba, just to sit on the beach and escape from everything. Everyone in Cuba was so kind, so accommodating, and addressed her respectfully. She even went out without any makeup, and still, everyone went out of their way to use her new pronouns. 

After two weeks, she contacted a local realtor and said she wanted to buy a house.

""Why would you want to stay here, when you could live anywhere in the world?"" asked the realtor.

An old mafia boss was at the end of his life,"He knew he didn't have much time left to live and he was getting worried about where he might end up after his death if he did not get absolution for his sins. He had been a very evil person and he knew that any old village priest would not be able to do the job so instead he arranged a meeting with the pope in Rome.

The pope listened to all the sins the mafia boss had committed. ""I can give you absolution for your sins,"" the pope said ""but let me be honest. It will take a lot of work and it is going to cost you""

The pope took out his calculator, added the numbers and answered.

""Fifty million dollars"" the pope said.

That was a lot of money to the mafia boss. He had known it was going to be expensive but he had not expected it to be that expensive.

He decided to get another offer so he arranged a meeting with the patriarch in Moscow. The patriarch listened to his sins, nodded and poured himself another glass of vodka. ""I can give you absolution for your sins"" he said ""but let me be honest. It will take a lot of work and it is going to cost you""

The patriarch took out his calculator, added the numbers and answered.

""Twenty million dollars"" the patriarch said.

That was sill a lot of money so the mafia boss decided to get a third offer and arranged a meeting with the chief rabbi in Jerusalem. The chief rabbi listened to his sins and said ""I can give you absolution for your sins, no problem"".

""How much will it cost me?"" the mafia boss asked.

The chief rabbi took out his calculator, added the numbers and answered

""Two hundred dollars"" he said.

The Farmer's New Addition,"There once was a farmer who owned luscious pastures. He proudly looked over them everyday. He always took care of all of his animals. 

Though one day he had brought in a new foal, a chestnut coloured one, that he thought was adorable.

He got him on the farm but the foal looked nervous so he stroked his fur and though it felt as soft as he'd ever imagined it felt unusual, he then housed it in the stable and got to work. 

A few days later whilst herding some sheep he felt a strange sensation in his legs. A small tingling. He looked down to see hew was covered in hair from the waist down and most strangely of all, he had hooves. These new legs of his forced him to naturally bend over. He found this fall to be gracefully cushioned by another pair of hooves on his newly hairy arms. Then suddenly his vision had become so impaired he could see for more of what was beside him than what was in front of him. Then after bursting out of all of his clothes he realised... He had become a mule. After clocking this he blacked out. 

He woke up in bed with his wife reassuringly stroking his human-like arm. She said ""Darling, you've been in bed all afternoon, are you alright?"".

He replied ""I'm mostly okay, I just felt a little hoarse"".",4,False,1567029423,Jokes,0,/r/Jokes/comments/cwrjcb/the_farmers_new_addition/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cwrjcb/the_farmers_new_addition/,cwrjcb,Mattasticone,

""My father's a butcher.""

""I see,"" the teacher remarked. ""I'm going to give you an example you're familiar with and hopefully that might help you better understand addition. Let's say I'm a butcher and I have the thigh of a lamb placed on a table. If I then put another lamb's thigh next to it, what would that make?""

The student instantly sprang up from his seat. ""A butt!"" he replied.

"All year, I've been telling my friends I just want to meet someone, fall in love be married by my next birthday...","which was my 40th birthday.  The BIG Four Oh! As in ""Oh, you're 40 and not married? What's wrong with you?""

And my friends, as awesome as they are, kept setting me up on blind dates, but I never seemed to click with any of the women. Pretty women, short women, tall women, rough women, successful women, lazy women - I dated them all and more often than not, they just weren't interested in me. 

I think I probably went on twenty or so dates that never resulted in a a single follow up date. 

But two months before my birthday, I started dating two women and they both fledgling relationships seemed like they were going somewhere as they were getting really, really serious. I couldn't choose one, but I didn't care. I just couldn't believe they were into me. Okay, maybe they weren't the best looking, but I was so desperate for a wife, and I'm definitely no prize myself. 

With a few weeks to go before my birthday, I knew I had to act if I had any hope of being married. I bought two rings and proposed to them both (on separate nights, of course) and they both said no. In fact, though they never knew of each other, I went from two good things to both of them not returning my calls. I guess proposing in a mall food court (for Jenny) or down on my knees in front of the bathroom at a minor league baseball game (Susan) were not my best laid plans, doomed to fail. Or maybe I just reeked of desperation.

So the morning of my birthday, I was practically in tears, deep in depression as I knew I missed my deadline. But my friends came though, kind of. They took me out  bar hopping and then we all went back to my place where they had a stripper waiting in my favorite chair. She got up, sat me down, and gave me a grinding lap dance.

"A Manchester United fan, Liverpool fan and an Everton fan were caught drinking in Saudi Arabia....","An Everton fan, a Liverpool fan and a Manchester United fan were all in Saudi Arabia drinking a smuggled crate of booze.

All of a sudden Saudi police rushed in and arrested them.

For their punishment the Saudi Arabia Sheik decided that the punishment should be 20 lashes with a whip.

As they were preparing for their punishment, the Sheik suddenly said: ""It is my first wife's birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping.""

The Manchester United fan was first in line (he had consumed the least), so he thought about it for a while and then said: ""Please tie a pillow to my back.""

This was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes before the whip went through it.

The Manchester United fan had to be carried away bleeding and crying when the punishment was done.

The Liverpool fan was next up (he almost finished a half-keg), and after watching the scene, said: ""Choice! Please fix two pillows on my back.""

But even two pillows could only take 15 lashes before the whip went through again.

The Everton fan was the last one up (he had finished off the keg), but before he could say anything, the Sheikh turned to him and said: ""You are from a most beautiful part of England, your city has some of the best and most loyal football fans in the world. For this, you may have two wishes!""

""Cheers mate, your Most Royal and Merciful highness"", the Everton fan replied.

""In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes.""

""Not only are you an honorable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave."" The Sheik said with an admiring look on his face.

""If 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. And your second wish? What is it to be?"" the Sheik asked.

A donut called James really wanted to ask his donut crush Stacy to the prom,"We’ll call this donut: James and his crush: Stacy.  So a few days before the donut prom James goes up to Stacy and asks her to the prom. She says: sorry James but I only go to the prom with frosted donuts. So James being the resilient donut he is, goes to the frosting store. He gets there and there’s this huge line outside the store. Hundreds of donuts all waiting to be frosted. He grits his teeth and waits in line to get frosted.

The next day after being frosted he goes up to Stacy again and says: “will you go to the prom with me now?” And Stacy says: “I’m sorry I only go to the prom with donuts who have suits”. So James promptly heads to the suit store, only to find a massive line outside of it again, clearly lots of donuts are wanting to look suave. He grits his teeth and waits in line again. 

The next day he goes up to Stacy in his brand new suit, all frosted and asks her again: “will you go to the prom with me?” Stacy being the shallow donut she is replied: “I only go to the prom with men who can take me there in a limo” so James begrudgingly heads to the limo hire store. Only to find again, a huge line for the limo store. Obviously lots of donuts want to arrive to their destination in style. James grits his teeth again and waits in line.

The next day, exasperated he goes up to Stacy and says: “look, I got frosted, I got a suit, I’ve got a limo hired, will you please go to the prom with me now?” And to James’ surprise Stacy said yes.

So the next day the two donuts went to prom together, James as happy as a donut could be. Once they got to the prom, James being the budding young lover asked Stacy if she wanted to have a dance. And she replied with: “I only dance with donuts who get me punch” so James through gritted teeth says: “ok” and heads to the table where the punch was being served.

""What I want you to do,"" the man continued, ""is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong.""

So they did. Each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.

Dear, Dad. It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you. I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mum and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy. She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight Motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, Dad. She's pregnant. Stacy said that we will be very happy. She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better. She sure deserves it!

Don't worry Dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself. Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

A homeless guy stopped me and demanded I give him £5 for some new shoes.,"So I gave him £5 and followed him to see if he got new shoes. He turned down one road, picking up the pace, the end of his baggy jeans scuffing the pavement. He took a sharp left turn down an alleyway, down which I pursued him for some three or four minutes at a safe distance of around three hundred yards.

&amp;#x200B;

Then we arrived at a large shopping centre, all sorts of shops. Perfume shops, clothes shops, and more importantly shoe shops. He wandered about with a charmingly enthusiastic nature, and went in a few of them to see what they offered. After the third shop - while I was sat on a bench - I saw him come out with a pair of white trainers.

&amp;#x200B;

I ran up to him and said, ""Fucking hell mate, well done.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Well done? You what? Wait--aren't you the guy that gave me...""

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, so you're a spider. You're born with hundreds of brothers and sisters. If your parents don't eat you, your brothers and sisters may just as well, so you leave as soon as you're able and setup on your own. No wonder you're a loner, one ugly eight legged, hairy beast. You spend hours building a unique and complex web that belongs only to you, to ensnare whatever comes your way. Boy can you climb. You have no friends, talk to no one and you'll inject poison into and eat anything that touches and becomes entangled in your web. Then one day she comes along. You let your guard down, fall head over heals in love, do the deed and she most likely eats you. Tasty children may follow but they all run away. Also, there are those ginormous two legged creatures that destroy your web and trap you in dome like see-through contraptions that change your environment and force you to start all over again. Happiness to you is a dead end with a smell to match, to keep away what cannot be eaten, anything for a bit of peace. What you keep very close to your chest is your mathematical genius, severe haemorrhoids and the ability to hum a good tune. If only you took the time to do a bit of tap..?|I hope you didn't lie to your wife.

Red Skelton staring at girls,"A funny joke told by Red Skelton about staring at girls on the Ed Sullivan show in 1968 – enjoy!

“Pardon while I comb my hair. I’m going to do it while I can; it  ain’t gonna be long, boy.  You know, I’m in my 50’s, did you know that  I’m in my 50’s, I’m in my late 50’s.  I’m 60 — you can’t get closer to  50 that that!

No, I’m still in my 50’s, and I still stare at girls.  I stare at girls, but I forgot why …

You know, when I was younger, I was a devil with the girls.  Not to  brag, I was a Dickens, boy.  Nothing in a skirt was safe, nothing!  ‘Til  I met that Scotchman, he almost beat my brains in!

He orders a glass of condensed milk and puts it on his table. Next time the waitress walks past he asks for a glass of black coffee. Now he has a glass of milk and a glass of coffee next to each other, this guy is real cool.

"Jeff has had only one dream ever in his life, to become a train conductor.","Jeff went to his local train station and begged for the job. He got a job, as a janitor. Every day he swept the train car floors. To make his job easier, he added certain style to his sweeping technique. He used a 3 level system for how powerful he wanted to sweep. He had a small sweep for small piles of dust. Medium sweeps for leftover chip bags and plactic bottles. And the Super Mega Large sweeps for when there were spider webs as big as the train.

Jeff was a master sweeper, so he got Promoted!.. To hobo kicking. Nowadays he comes to the train station early in the morning, finds the nearest hobo, and kicks him out. However, Jeff's legs hurt after several strong kicks, so he used his 3 level system in hobo kicking. He had a small kick for tiny, bite sized hobos. Medium kicks for your average sized hobo. And his Super Mega Powerful kick for 300 pound hobos.

Jeff was sooooo good at kicking hobos and he was Promoted!.. to coal shoveling. Jeff arrives 20 minutes before his train departure, loads up with the conductor, and shovels coal. likewise with his legs, Jeff's arms got tired after several large piles of shoveled coal, so he used his 3 level system to rest Jeff's weak arms. Jeff dumps small piles of coal in the incinerator to send the train at a slow pace. He dumps a Medium pile for a somewhat fast pace. But when the train station's 30 miles away and he's scheduled to arrive in 7 minutes, Jeff uses his Big Gargantuan Humongous shoveling strength to send the train at super sonic speed!

After all of Jeff's many years of working for this train station, they finally promote him to Train Conductor! Jeff shows up to work 30 minutes early on his first day, conducts the train for his first time ever, and crashes the train. He injures 30 and kills 13 more. Jeff is sentenced to Death.

The day of Jeff's execution, he's asked for his last meal. Jeff tells the guard that he wants a 13 foot stack of pancakes and a 40 ounce jug of green Kool-Aid. Jeff takes exactly 34 minutes to eat with it all. 26 Mintues later, Jeff is taken to the electric chair.

Jeff sits down in the electric chair, and is strapped in by a nearby guard. After all the safety precautions, they turn on the electric chair. 

BZZZZZZ

Nothin happened. The guard is confused and Jeff is confused. The guard trys it again.

BZZZZZZ

Nothing. Jeff doesn't even move a muscle. The guard decides to let Jeff go since he can't kill him. Before Jeff leaves, the guard has one question.

The Rude Parrot,"A young man named John received a parrot as a gift.
The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary.
Every word out of the bird’s mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity.
John tried and tried to change the bird’s attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to clean up the bird’s vocabulary.
Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot.
The parrot yelled back.
John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even more rude.
John, in desperation, threw up his hands, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer.
For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed.
Then suddenly there was total quiet.
Not a peep was heard for over a minute.
Fearing that he’d hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer.
The parrot calmly stepped out onto John’s outstretched arms and said
“I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I’m sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior.”
John was stunned at the change in the bird’s attitude.
As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird spoke up, and asked very softly :
“May I ask what the turkey did?”

A plumber and a contractor were arguing about something in a huge box.,"The contractor was adamant that whatever was in  the box would not go in the building at any cost. The plumber insisted he was just trying to do his job and that it was imperative that the box go into the master bathroom. The contractor turned him away despite warnings that there would be consequences. Upon hearing this, the owner of the building got angry and hired a new contractor. The new contractor also wouldn't allow the contents of the large box into the building. He was also fired and a new contractor hired. This contractor was a fun person, giving the workers breaks and buying them lunch. Out of fondness, the workers warned him that when plumber comes, he should allow the box to go into the building. So the contractor asked how important the contents of the box were and the workers replied, ""Two people have been fired for not listening to the plumber, just let that sink in""",16,False,1568014785,dadjokes,2,/r/dadjokes/comments/d1nqoc/a_plumber_and_a_contractor_were_arguing_about/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes/comments/d1nqoc/a_plumber_and_a_contractor_were_arguing_about/,d1nqoc,average_name_of_user,This made me smile thanks

Funny quotes from Blackadder the Third,"Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): I have come up with a plan so cunning you could stick a tail on it and call it a weasel.

&amp;#x200B;

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): Morning, Mr. B.

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): Leave me alone, Baldrick. If I wanted to talk to a vegetable, I would have bought one at the market.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Referring to a suicide pill they have both been given, after being captured by French revolutionaries\]

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): I’m glad to say you won’t be needing that pill, Mr. B.

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): Am I jumping the gun, Baldrick, or are the words “I have a cunning plan” marching with ill-deserved confidence in the direction of this conversation?

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): They certainly are.

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): Well, forgive me if I don’t do a cartwheel of joy; your record in this department is hardly 100%. So what is it?

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): We do nothing …

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): Yup, it’s another world-beater.

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): No, wait. We do nothing … until our heads have actually been cut off.

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): And then we … spring into action?

&amp;#x200B;

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): \[to Baldrick\] Unless I think of something, tomorrow we go to meet our Maker: in my case God, in your case God knows.

&amp;#x200B;

Baldrick (Tony Robinson): Sounds like a bag of grapefruits to me, Mr B.

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): The phrase, Baldrick, is “a case of sour grapes” – and yes it bloody well is.

&amp;#x200B;

Mrs. Miggins: The Scarlet Pimpernel, Mr. Blackadder! He’s so exciting, don’t you think?

Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson): Actually, I think he’s the most over-rated human being since Judas Iscariot won the AD31 Best Disciple Competition.

"One day, Kermit the Frog was a little short on cash, so he went to the bank to speak to a loan officer...","When he got there, a woman extended her hand.

""Good afternoon, sir,"" she said. ""My name is Patricia Wack. How may I help you today?""
Kermit replied, ""Hi-ho, Patricia! I'm Kermit the Frog, and I would like to borrow some money.""

They walked over to her desk and sat down.

""Certainly, Mr. Frog--""
""Oh, just call me Kermit.""
""Okay... Kermit. How much money would you like to borrow?""
""Ten thousand dollars.""

Mildly surprised, Ms. Wack looked intently at Kermit.

""Do you have any references?""
""Well, I suppose I could use my father, Keith Richards.""

Ms. Wack froze for a second, then...

""THE Keith Richards?""
""Oh, yes. In fact, he told me he's friends with your manager, which is why I came in here.""
""Okay... Do you have any collateral?""
""Excuse me?""
""Collateral. Something of value, like a car, or a boat...""
""Oh, yes! I do have something. I have this.""

Kermit reached into his briefcase and placed a small figurine on the desk. Patricia looked curiously at the object, then at our amphibious friend.

""What's this?""
""It's a Hummel.""
""A what?""
""A Hummel. They're supposed to be quite valuable. Well, at least this one is to me.""

She picked up the Hummel and stood up.

""If you don't mind, I would like to show this to the manager.""
""Oh, no! I don't mind at all!""

So, Patricia took the Hummel to the manager's office, knocked on the door, and walked inside.

""Patricia! What can I do for you?""
""Mr. Wilson, there's this... frog named Kermit at my desk, and he wants to borrow $10,000, but he has only this for collateral.""

Mr. Wilson looked at the Hummel, then out to her desk. 

""I don't see anything out of order here.""

A First-Grade Novel,"Joe was sitting down on his front steps, looking as though he had  lost his last dollar.  His friend, Dan, walked by, and asked him what  the matter was.

Joe answered, “Well, you know how I’ve been working on a novel part-time for years, right?”

Dan nodded.  Joe continued, “Well, I finally finished it and  submitted it to a publisher, and they wrote back, telling me that I had  written a first-grade novel.”

Dan excitedly said, “That’s great!  Why do you look so glum?”

Joe sighed and said, “Because they also said that most of their readers have gone past the first grade.”

"All year, I've been telling my friends I just want to meet someone, fall in love be married by my next birthday...","which was my 40th birthday. The BIG Four Oh! As in ""Oh, you're 40 and not married? What's wrong with you?""

And my friends, as awesome as they are, kept setting me up on blind dates, but I never seemed to click with any of the women. Pretty women, short women, tall women, rough women, successful women, lazy women - I dated them all and more often than not, they just weren't interested in me.

I think I probably went on twenty or so dates that never resulted in a a single follow up date.

But two months before my birthday, I started dating two women and both fledgling relationships seemed like they were going somewhere as they were getting really, really serious. I couldn't choose one, but I didn't care. I just couldn't believe they were into me. Okay, maybe they weren't the best looking, but I was so desperate for a wife, and I'm definitely no prize myself.

With a few weeks to go before my birthday, I knew I had to act if I had any hope of being married. I bought two rings and proposed to them both (on separate nights, of course) and they both said no. In fact, though they never knew of each other, I went from two good things to both of them not returning my calls. I guess proposing in a mall food court (for Jenny) or down on my knees in front of the bathroom at a minor league baseball game (Susan) were not my best laid plans, doomed to fail. Or maybe I just reeked of desperation.

So the morning of my birthday, I was practically in tears, deep in depression as I knew I missed my deadline. But my friends came though, kind of. They took me out bar hopping and then we all went back to my place where they had a stripper waiting in my favorite chair. She got up, sat me down, and gave me a grinding lap dance. She said nothing, but after a minute, stopped, turned around, looked me in the eye and said ""one."" Then she started up again, stopped after a minute, turned around and said ""two...""

This went on all night until she got to ""forty.""

It's been a few months now, and I'm not too sad.

From edepot.com:
When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.

When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, ""Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards.""

He listened a while longer, and said, ""There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling."" So the magistrate kept listening; ""There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth...""

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, ""My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing.""

Betting on the man jumping off a ledge,"Two clowns were watching the late evening news. The current news story  was about a man up on a ledge and threatening to jump. The station then  cut to a commercial.

The first clown said, “I bet you $20 he’s going to jump.”

The second clown replied  “Okay, it’s a bet!”

(*Back to newscast*.) The man jumped.

The second clown, being a good sport, pulled out a twenty dollar bill and handed it to the other clown. “Okay. Here’s my $20.”

However, the first clown refused, saying “No, I can’t take it.”

The second clown replied, “I insist. I lost the bet fair and square.”

The first clown said, “I have a confession to make. I saw the same  thing on the 6:00 news and knew he jumped. So it wasn’t really a fair  bet.”

But the second clown replied, “I know. I saw the same newscast. But I didn’t think he would be stupid enough to jump twice!”

An ant joke,"🐜An ant knocked on the door of a house.

The house owner opened the door.

""I want a place to stay,"" said the ant.

""I have a vacant room which you can occupy for free of cost,"" said the owner.

The ant went inside and occupied the vacant room.

After some days, the ant brought in another ant 🐜and requested the
owner, ""Can you please allow this ant to stay with me?""

""Oh sure, you can do so without paying any rent,"" said the owner.

After some days the ant brought a 3rd 🐜ant and requested the owner
to allow it to stay with them.

The owner agreed to it without asking for any rent.

This went on as the 🐜ant brought in more and more ants and the owner agreed to let them stay without any rent.

One fine day, the ant brought in the  *10th* ant 🐜and requested the owner
to allow it to stay with them all.

The owner said, 
""OK, you can all stay here but now you all need to pay rent.""

*Now the question is:*

Why did the owner ask for rent when the 10th ant came in?

What did the astronaut say to the lawyer?,"A dad joke is a short joke, typically a pun, presented as a one-liner or a question and answer, but not a narrative.[1] Generally inoffensive, dad jokes are stereotypically told by fathers among family, either with sincere humorous intent, or to intentionally provoke a negative reaction to its overly-simplistic humor.
Many dad jokes may be considered anti-jokes, deriving humor from an intentionally unfunny punchline.[2] An example dad jokes goes as follows: A child will say to the dad, ""I'm hungry,"" to which the dad will reply, ""Hi, Hungry, I'm Dad.""
While the exact origin of the term dad joke is unknown, a writer for the Gettysburg Timeswrote an impassioned defense of the genre in June of 1987 under the headline ""Don't ban the 'Dad' jokes; preserve and revere them""[3]. The earliest known use of the term online was on B3ta Forums in December 2003. On a thread titled ""Dad Jokes"", users shared ""lame jokes"" made by their fathers[4]. The term ""dad jokes"" received mentions in Australian quiz show Spicks and Specks in 2009,[5] and in the American sitcom How I Met Your Mother in 2008[6]. However, the term spread into general use only after 2014 with increasing numbers of web searches on Google.[7]",0,False,1566902134,dadjokes,0,/r/dadjokes/comments/cw2lg9/what_did_the_astronaut_say_to_the_lawyer/,https://www.reddit.com/r/dadjokes/comments/cw2lg9/what_did_the_astronaut_say_to_the_lawyer/,cw2lg9,BlockBite456,
