    "Now, with cleaned data, engineered features, and train/test splits prepared, we're ready to move into the modeling phases. Because we're dealing with a number of different model types, we are going to start by constructing **param grids** for our vectorizers (CountVectorizer, TfIdfVectorizer). **Vecorization** of our text data is an essential step in NLP-- it enables us to numerically represent text data. In the case of *CountVectorizer*, each word in our corpus is translated into a feature, and counts the word frequencies. It's a simple representation of our text. In the case of *TfidfVectorizer*, words that occur more frequently are weighted higher in our model; words that do not appear frequently recieve lower weighting. This approach helps to drown out some of the noise in our text data. \n",

In our case, we'll look at **max features**, **ngram range**, **min_df**, and **stop words**. Max features establishes a cutoff for the number of words presented in our model; n-gram range refers to our ability to couple words together to prevent context from being lost when tokenizing our words; min_df refers to the document-level frequency threshold that needs to be met by a word to be part of our model; stopwords refer to whether or not our model will strip out common english language terms, or keep them in. In the case of the stop words, this is particularly interesting to test for jokes, which can be quite short in length."

Our coefficients will relate back to our binary target in the following way: **particularly negative coefficients will be more predictive of our negative outcome (r/Jokes); particularly positive coefficients will be more predictive of our positive outcome (r/DadJokes)**. As we dig in, we realize that more negative coeffcients are generally associated with offensive topics (religion, race); more positive coefficients are more closely associated with familial/simple contextual terms (daughter/father; walking/eating). We can plot these to better chart these relationships."

    "**Sensitivity is very good** for our model. This means that when the model predicts that a post is from r/DadJokes, it's often the case that this is true. On the other hand, **specificity is very, very bad here**. This means that it is not very good at all at effectively telling us when a joke actually belongs to **r/Jokes**. Given what we see above, it does appear that there are a good amount of r/Jokes observations that could, from a human vantage point, be interpreted as r/DadJokes."
